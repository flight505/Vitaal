## 1. GLP-1 Metabolic Optimization Program

### Scientific Foundation

GLP-1 receptor agonists represent a paradigm shift in metabolic medicine, offering benefits far beyond weight loss. Our comprehensive program leverages the latest research to maximize outcomes while minimizing side effects.

## Key Evidence

- **SELECT Trial (2024)**: 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in non-diabetics [@select2024]
- **ELAD Trial**: 18% reduction in cognitive decline with liraglutide in mild Alzheimer's [@mulvaney2024]
- **Anti-inflammatory Effects**: 44% reduction in C-reactive protein independent of weight loss [@wilding2023]
- **Metabolic Benefits**: Average 15% weight loss, 30% reduction in liver fat, improved insulin sensitivity

## Treatment Components

### Medication Selection
- **Semaglutide (Wegovy/Ozempic)**: First-line for most patients
- **Liraglutide (Saxenda)**: Alternative for daily dosing preference
- **Tirzepatide**: For enhanced glycemic control needs

### Combination Strategies
- **Metformin addition**: 1-2% additional HbA1c reduction, 5-15% enhanced weight loss
- **SGLT-2 inhibitors**: Added cardiovascular protection for high-risk patients
- **Targeted supplements**: B12, folate to prevent deficiencies

### Muscle Preservation Protocol
- Mandatory resistance training 2-3x/week
- Protein intake: 1.2-1.5g/kg body weight
- Leucine supplementation: 2.5g with meals
- Quarterly DEXA scans to monitor body composition

### Expected Outcomes

| Metric | 3 Months | 6 Months | 12 Months |
|--------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Weight Loss | 8-10% | 12-15% | 15-20% |
| HbA1c Reduction | 0.8-1.2% | 1.0-1.5% | 1.2-2.0% |
| Blood Pressure | -5-8 mmHg | -8-12 mmHg | -10-15 mmHg |
| Inflammation (CRP) | -30% | -40% | -44% |
