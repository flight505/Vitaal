### Market Drivers and Trends

#### 1. Regulatory Gaps Creating Private Markets

The Danish healthcare system's structural changes have inadvertently created significant private market opportunities:

- **GLP-1 Coverage Loss**: Wegovy lost all insurance coverage (January 2024), creating €365/month private market
- **Diabetes Treatment Restrictions**: Patients must try cheaper alternatives before accessing premium medications
- **Limited Preventive Care**: Public system focuses on acute care, minimal preventive services
- **Waiting Lists**: 4-12 week delays for specialist appointments driving private alternatives

#### 2. Economic Fundamentals

Denmark's strong economy supports premium healthcare spending:

- Per capita healthcare spending: $7,140 (58% above developed country average)
