## Vitaal Klinic: Pioneering Metabolic Health & Longevity Medicine in Denmark

### Investment Opportunity

Vitaal Klinic represents a transformative €1.5-2.0 million investment opportunity to establish Denmark's first integrated metabolic health and longevity center at Jagtvej 113, Copenhagen. By leveraging Dr. Peyman Pedrampour's established GP practice with 3,500 patients and Dr. Jesper Vang's bioinformatics expertise, we address a €1-1.2 billion market gap in Danish healthcare.

### The Opportunity

Denmark's healthcare landscape has created unique conditions for premium preventive medicine:

- **Regulatory Gap**: GLP-1 therapies for weight loss (Wegovy) lost all insurance coverage in January 2024, creating a €365/month private market
- **Supply-Demand Imbalance**: Public system backlogs and limited preventive care access drive affluent patients to seek private alternatives
- **Cultural Readiness**: 84% of Danes embrace telemedicine; 73% report increased health focus post-COVID
- **Economic Foundation**: Denmark ranks #1 in Europe for weight-loss searches, with one-third of GLP-1 users being non-diabetic

### Our Solution

Vitaal Klinic integrates five evidence-based interventions into a comprehensive longevity program:

1. **GLP-1 Metabolic Optimization**: Beyond weight loss, offering 20% cardiovascular risk reduction [@select2024] and potential 18% cognitive improvement [@mulvaney2024]

2. **Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)**: First private provider in Denmark, delivering 20-38% telomere lengthening based on Tel Aviv protocols [@hachmo2020]

3. **Precision Genetic Testing**: Partnership with GenomeScan for comprehensive genomic analysis and personalized treatment protocols

4. **Advanced Biomarker Monitoring**: Collaboration with Unilabs for cutting-edge diagnostics including epigenetic age testing

5. **IV Nutrient Therapies**: Evidence-based NAD+ and glutathione protocols for cellular optimization
